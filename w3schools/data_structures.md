# Data Structures
1. Vector
   1. can change in size
   2. adding and removing at the end
   3. accessed by index
2. List
   1. adding and removing at both ends
   2. not accessible by index
3. Stack
   1. LIFO
   2. added and removed from the top
   3. not accessible by index
4. Queue
   1. FIFO
   2. added at the end and removed from the front
   3. not accessible by index
5. Deque
   1. added and removed from both ends
   2. accessible by index
6. Set
   1. stores unique elements
   2. not accessible by index
7. Map
   1. stores elements in "key/value" pairs
   2. accessible by keys (not by index)

## How to use them
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <stack>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <map>
```

## STL Key Cocepts
- containers
  - data structures that provide a way to store data, like vectors, lists, etc
- iterators
  - objects used to access elements of a data structures
- algorithms
  - includes functions like sort() and find(), perform operations on data structures through iterators
